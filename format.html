<div>
	<h3>The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is: $U_{n} = U_{1} r^{n-1}$ </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>$U_{1} = U_{1} r^{1-1}$</li>
		<li>$U_{2} = U_{1} r^{2-1}$</li>
		<li>$U_{3} = U_{1} r^{3-1}$</li>
	</ul>

<div>
<h3>Another way to write the formula for the sum to n terms of a geometric sequence is:  </h3>
<p style = "padding: 10px">$S_{n} = \frac{U_{1}(1-r^{n})}{1-r} $  </p>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
 <li>This cell bellow contains a code to output the first 4 terms of a geometric sequence. Take a look at the code and then run the cell.<li> 
 	<li>On line 12 write a print statement to output the 5th term.  Notice that we are starting with 0, so you will want to use 4 for the exponent. Talk with a classmate about why we are starting to count by 0 in this case. *side-note: In Computer Science we generally start counting with 0 instead of 1.</li>
</ol>
