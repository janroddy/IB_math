<h1 style= padding:10px>Currency Conversions</h1>
<ul>
	<li>To change once currency to another either multiple the amount by the appropriate exchange rate (if the bank is buying) or divide the amount by the appropriate exchange rate (if the bank is selling).</li>
	<li>If the bank charges commission, calculate this first and subtract it from the amount before you change currency.</li>
</ul>

Example 13: Zoran wants to change 200 Singapore dollars (SGD) to euros.  The exchange rate is 1SGD = 0.588 euros. The bank charges 2% commission.  Calculate how many euros Zoran receives.
