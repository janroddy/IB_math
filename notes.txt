Arithmetic Sequences: you can find each term by adding (or subtracting) the same number to the term before 

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: 
u_1 = first term in series 
d = common difference 

u_n = u_1 + (n-1)*d 


prints arithmetic sequence up to the nth term

The sum up to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
S(n) = n/2(2*u + (n-1)* d)






Another formula for the sum to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is 
S(n) = n/2(u_1 +u)














Geometric sequences 


The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:
u_n = u_1 * r ** (n-1)

n= 8
u_1 = 24
r= .5

A formula for the sum to n terms of a geometric sequence is: 
s_n = (u_1 (r**n -1))/(r - 1)

Another formula for sum to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is: 
s_n = (n/2) (u_1 + u_n)
