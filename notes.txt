Arithmetic Sequences: you can find each term by adding (or subtracting) the same number to the term before 

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: 
u_1 = first term in series 
d = common difference 

u_n = u_1 + (n-1)*d 


prints arithmetic sequence up to the nth term

The sum up to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
S(n) = n/2(2*u + (n-1)* d)

Another formula for the sum to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is 
S(n) = n/2(u_1 +u)
