Arithmetic Sequences: you can find each term by adding (or subtracting) the same number to the term before 

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: 
u_1 = first term in series 
d = common difference 

u_n = u_1 + (n-1)*d 


prints arithmetic sequence up to the nth term

The sum up to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
S(n) = n/2(2*u + (n-1)* d)






Another formula for the sum to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is 
S(n) = n/2(u_1 +u)



















Geometric sequences 
print series 

u_1 * pow(r, i) 

The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:
u_n = u_1 * r ** (n-1)


A formula for the sum to n terms of a geometric sequence is: 
s_n = (u_1 (r**n -1))/(r - 1)

Another formula for sum to n terms of an arithmetic sequence is: 
s_n = (u_1 * (1- r**n)) / (1 - r)











Currency conversions 
to change currency to another either multiply the amount by the appropriate exchange rate (if the bank is buying)
or 
divide the amount by the appropriate exchange rate (if the bank is selling) 
if the bank charges a commission calculate this first and subtract it from the amount before you charge currency 

example 13: p.310
Zoran wants to change 200 Singapore dollars (SGD) to euros.  The exchange rate is 1SGD = 0.588 euros. The bank charges 2% commission.  Calculate how many euros Zoran receives.  











Compound Interest 
The formula for calculating the future value of an investment with compound interest is 

future_value = present_value * (1 + r/(k(100)))**(nk)
